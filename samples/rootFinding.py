"""
A list of very useful functions for rapid guess-and-test (or root-finding) situations.
Using these functions will typically be much faster than a custom-built guess-and-check with a while() loop.


For more information on these functions, see the wikidepia page on root finding:

"""


def secant(a, b, fn, epsilon):
    """
     One of the fasest root-finding algorithms.
     The method calculates the slope of the function fn and this enables it to converge to a solution very fast.
     However, if started too far away from a root, the method may not converge (returning a 'NaN').
     For this reason, it is recommended that this function be used first in any guess-and-check workflow
     and, if it fails to find a root, the bisect() method should be used.

     Args:
        a: The lowest possible boundary of the value you are tying to find.
        b: The highest possible boundary of the value you are tying to find.
        fn: A function representing the relationship between the value you are
            trying to find and the target condition you are trying to satisfy.
            It should be structured in the following way:
            def fn(valueTryingToFind):
                functWResult(valueTryingToFind) - targetDesiredFromfunctWResult
        epsilon: The acceptable error in the targetDesiredFromfunctWResult.

    Returns:
        root: The value that gives the targetDesiredFromfunctWResult.

    """
    f1 = fn(a)
    if abs(f1) <= epsilon:
        return a
    f2 = fn(b)
    if abs(f2) <= epsilon:
        return b
    for i in range(100):
        slope = (f2 - f1) / (b - a)
        c = b - f2 / slope
        f3 = fn(c)
        if abs(f3) < epsilon:
            return c

        b = c
        f1 = f2
        f2 = f3

    return 'NaN'


def bisect(a, b, fn, epsilon, target):
    """
    The simplest root-finding algorithm.
    It is extremely reliable and is gauranteed to converge to a solution as long as a solution exists.
    However, it converges slowly and, for this reason, it is recommended that this only be used
    after the secant() method has returned a 'NaN'.

    Args:
       a: A lower guess of the value you are tying to find.
       b: A higher guess of the value you are tying to find.
       fn: A function representing the relationship between the value you are
           trying to find and the target condition you are trying to satisfy.
           It should be structured in the following way:
           def fn(valueTryingToFind):
               functWResult(valueTryingToFind) - targetDesiredFromfunctWResult
       epsilon: The acceptable error in the targetDesiredFromfunctWResult.

   Returns:
       root: The value that gives the targetDesiredFromfunctWResult.
