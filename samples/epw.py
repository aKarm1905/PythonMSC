This convention along with values for each "column" (left to right) is presented in Table 16. Note that some formats (e.g. TMY) does not follow this convention - as much as possible, the present weather codes are converted to this convention during WeatherConverter processing. Also note that the most important fields are those representing liquid precipitation - where the surfaces of the building would be wet. EnergyPlus uses "Snow Depth" to determine if snow is on the ground.
